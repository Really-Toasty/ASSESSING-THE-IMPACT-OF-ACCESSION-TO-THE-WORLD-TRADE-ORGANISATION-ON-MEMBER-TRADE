This study quantitatively measures the effect GATT/WTO membership has had on
bilateral trade. Using a Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood-high-dimensional-fixed-
effects (PPMLHDFE) model using IMF bilateral trade data from 1960 to 2020,
evidence suggests that a pair of members trade 62% more than a pair of non-members.
Furthermore, a country pair with only one member trade 34% more than a pair of non-
members. These results are consistent with literature that similarly found positive
membership effects.
Additionally, evidence suggests that the membership trade effects for developing
countries was marginally stronger for those that accessioned after 1995. The results
highlight the significance of committing to obligations during the accession process.
